Yajurveda is a compound Sanskrit word, composed of yajus (यजुस्) and Veda (वेद). Monier-Williams translates yajus as "religious reverence, veneration, worship, sacrifice, a sacrificial prayer, formula, particularly mantras uttered in a peculiar manner at a sacrifice".[13] Veda means "knowledge". Johnson states yajus means "(mostly) prose formulae or mantras, contained in the Yajur Veda, which are muttered".[14]

Michael Witzel interprets Yajurveda to mean a "knowledge text of prose mantras" used in Vedic rituals.[4] Ralph Griffith interprets the name to mean "knowledge of sacrifice or sacrificial texts and formulas".[15] Carl Olson states that Yajurveda is a text of "mantras (sacred formulas) that are repeated and used in rituals".[16]
